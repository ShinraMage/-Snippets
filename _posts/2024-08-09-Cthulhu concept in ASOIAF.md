### References and Connections

1. **Lovecraftian Influence:**
   - **George R.R. Martin** has openly acknowledged the influence of H.P. Lovecraft on his writing. The sense of cosmic horror, ancient deities, and unknowable forces present in Lovecraft's work can be seen in Martin's depiction of the **Great Other**, the mysterious god opposed to R'hllor, the Lord of Light. While not a direct reference, this kind of thematic similarity shows Martin's appreciation for Lovecraftian horror.
  
2. **The Great Other:**
   - In the world of **A Song of Ice and Fire**, the Great Other is a mysterious and malevolent deity associated with darkness, cold, and death. It is often mentioned by followers of the Lord of Light as the eternal enemy of their fiery god, R'hllor. The Great Other is never described directly, leaving its true nature and form ambiguous, which resonates with Lovecraft's style of leaving much to the imagination.
   - While the Great Other is not explicitly Nyarlathotep, the idea of an ancient, malevolent force manipulating events from the shadows can draw parallels to Nyarlathotep's role in Lovecraft’s mythology.

3. **Nyarlathotep's Characteristics:**
   - **Nyarlathotep** is known as the "Crawling Chaos," a shape-shifting entity that serves as a messenger and manipulator for the Outer Gods. He often interacts with humans, sowing madness and chaos. The mysterious and manipulative nature of some entities in **A Song of Ice and Fire** might echo Nyarlathotep’s role.
  
4. **The Faceless Men:**
   - The Faceless Men, a guild of assassins, worship the Many-Faced God, a deity of death with many aspects. The concept of a god with multiple faces and identities can be likened to Nyarlathotep’s shape-shifting and multifaceted nature.

5. **Easter Eggs and Tributes:**
   - Martin includes various Easter eggs and tributes to Lovecraft throughout his work. For example, the city of **R'lyeh** is referenced in the name of **R’hllor**, and the term “Old Ones” is used in both mythologies. These nods show Martin’s respect and admiration for Lovecraft’s creations.

### Conclusion

While **Nyarlathotep** does not appear as a literal character in **A Song of Ice and Fire**, the series contains numerous elements inspired by Lovecraftian themes and creatures. Martin's intricate world-building and the eerie, ancient forces at play certainly echo the atmosphere found in Lovecraft’s tales, providing fans of cosmic horror with familiar touches.
